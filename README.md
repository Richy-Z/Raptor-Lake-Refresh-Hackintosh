# ü¶Ö Raptor Lake Refresh Hackintosh with OpenCore
An OpenCore EFI configured for my personal Raptor Lake Refresh (Intel 14th Generation) system.

This Hackintosh is currently a fluke - I don't have much of an idea of how or why this hack even works.

After I changed an unknown BIOS setting or something in config.plist, it randomly decided to boot into the macOS Installer instead of the kernel panicking. I was so relieved but also surprised that I ended up regaining faith in God and started praying - like literally...
> "Thank You God for such a blessed day!"

Because of my lack of knowledge of completely unsupported systems with OpenCore (I only have experience with supported configurations such as an Intel Core i7-10700KF as an example), I will not be providing in-depth explanations here before I conduct a further investigation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è BIOS Options
### ‚ùå Disable
- Fast Boot
- Secure Boot
    - **Secure Boot Mode:** Standard
    - **Secure Boot State:** Setup
    - Key management will turn off with these Secure Boot settings, however, this is required.
- Compatibility Support Module (CSM)
- Discrete Thunderbolt Support
- UEFI Variable Protection
  - This doesn't have to stay disabled - only for Post-Install Configuration.

### ‚úÖ Enable
- VT-d and VT-x
- Above 4G Decoding
  - Resize BAR Support will become available - turn it on too.
- Hyper-Threading
- XHCI Handoff
- OS Type: Other OS
  - Contrary to what the OpenCore Install Guide says, we will set this to "Other OS" to disable Microsoft Secure Boot which isn't required for macOS.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Other BIOS Settings
- Intel XMP
  - Intel XMP does not cause issues. This can be enabled to enhance the performance of your hack.
- ASUS AI Tweaker (BIOS Automatic Overclocking)
  - Although untested, it should not cause any problems.
  - *Where exactly is the AI in this lol? It's just a BIOS... I dont expect it to have any AI features. How would you as a BIOS Vendor even implement that, and furthermore, how would American Megatrends implement it lol?*

### DeviceProperties >> GPU Path
| Name      | Type   | Value                 |
| --------- | ------ | --------------------- |
| device-id | Data   | BF730000              |
| model     | String | AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT |

In [TylerLyczak's Guide for fixing RX 6900 XT support](https://github.com/TylerLyczak/Unsupported-6900XT-Hackintosh-Fix), the model string he set was `Radeon RX 6900 XT (XTXH)`. However, I believe that his model name didn't adhere to Apple's way of product naming.

I watched [MKBHD's MacPro7,1 Unboxing Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOPswcaSsu8) and I found out that Apple tends not to include advanced information such as the GPU variant (in our case, `(XTXH)`. Apple is always for simplicity. So I made it `AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT` as that is how Apple would present it.

Remember, this is PURELY COSMETIC! So naming here doesn't matter much. I'm just going for the ultimate Apple experience.

## üîê Fixing CFG Lock on ASUS TUF Gaming B760M-Plus
UEFI Variable Protection must be disabled in the BIOS.
After that, [instructions from the OpenCore Post-Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/misc/msr-lock.html) can be followed as-is.

In my case, `VarOffset` was `0x44`. This meant that I had to use the following command in the [Modified GRUB Shell](https://github.com/datasone/grub-mod-setup_var):
```grub
setup_var_cv CpuSetup 0x44 0x01 0x00
```
The command above writes one byte of information, `0x00`, to offset `0x44` in `CpuSetup`.
